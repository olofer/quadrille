# quadrille

Interactive display of a gridded 2D plane in the browser, useful for basic animation projects. Use arrows to translate the view and use shift+up/down to zoom the view. Press the `tab` key to cycle through the available demo simulations. Each demo simulation has its own keyboard control logic.

Available demo applications at this time:
1. Bouyant quadrilateral object bopping in water waves (on-load default).
2. Self-gravitating system of particles which also repel when too close to one another.
3. A "do nothing" category.
